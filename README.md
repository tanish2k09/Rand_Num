# Rand_Num

App :

The latest build of the app can be found inside the bin folder.

Intro :
----------
Hi guys! I am new to Android app development and here is my second basic app that generates a random number between a user-specified range. The upper and lower limiter numbers are input by the user. Negative numbers aren't supported as of now.

----------
Note :
----------
CURRENTLY ONLY MAXIMUM OF 10-DIGITS CAN BE HANDLED. A GREATER NUMBER WOULD CAUSE AN EXCEPTION THAT IS NOT HANDLED BY THE APP (devs would know what this is). SO THE GENERATED NUMBER MIGHT SHOW "2147483647" MOST OF THE TIME.

-------------------
Easter eggs :
-------------------
1) If you enter the same value for lower and upper limits, the app would automatically set the upper limit to (lower limit+100). But that change won't be visible to humans.

2) You can actually enter the minimum value greater than the maximum value. The app automatically treats the bigger number as the upper limit.

Since it is a totally beginner-level app, please don't criticise it for bad UI, lack of features etc... I'm just learning.
DON'T EXPECT ME TO UPDATE IT REGULARLY. THIS IS JUST MY HOBBY AND DO IT IN FREE TIME.
